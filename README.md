Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢
This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not, based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information about individual Titanic passengers, such as:

PassengerId

Survived (Target Variable: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Pclass (Ticket class)

Name

Sex

Age

SibSp (No. of siblings/spouses aboard)

Parch (No. of parents/children aboard)

Ticket

Fare

Cabin

Embarked (Port of Embarkation)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Approach
Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values

Converting categorical variables to numeric

Dropping irrelevant columns

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understanding data distribution

Visualizing survival trends based on features like gender, age, class, etc.

Feature Engineering:

Creating new features

Scaling/encoding existing ones

Model Building:

Applied classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)

Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

✅ Results
Achieved high accuracy in predicting passenger survival with the best-performing model.

📌 Conclusion
The project showcases how basic machine learning and data preprocessing techniques can be applied to historical datasets for predictive analysis.
